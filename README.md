# LocalCam

LocalCam is a Windows desktop WPF app for discovering compatible cameras on the local network and viewing RTSP streams in a multi-tile viewer. The implementation is Tapo-first under the hood, but the user-facing app is branded as a generic network camera viewer.

## What It Does

- Discovers local-network cameras with heuristic scanning
- Shows live camera tiles in a single window
- Plays RTSP streams with LibVLCSharp
- Lets you start and stop streams per tile or all at once
- Supports per-tile snapshot capture
- Supports per-tile manual recording with automatic 60-minute segment rollover
- Keeps discovery and streaming status visible in the main window footer

## Current UI

- Main window opens directly to the camera dashboard
- Local camera discovery runs on load and can be retried from the same window
- Per-tile controls include:
  - Play/Stop
  - Snapshot
  - Record / Stop Recording
  - Expand / Collapse while video is playing
- Settings are available from the toolbar

## Settings

The Settings dialog currently covers:

- RTSP username
- RTSP password
- RTSP stream path
- Auto-stream
- Snapshot save folder
- Recording save folder

Defaults and persistence:

- Settings persist to `%LocalAppData%\LocalCam\settings.json`
- Window bounds are persisted
- Preferred detection method is persisted
- Snapshot files default to `%UserProfile%\Pictures\LocalCam`
- Recording files default to `%UserProfile%\Videos\LocalCam`
- The app shows `Pictures` or `Videos` in the UI when the active save folder matches those default locations

## Discovery

Discovery is best-effort and heuristic-based, not authoritative.

Current scan behavior:

- Enumerates active network interfaces
- Ignores loopback and tunnel interfaces
- Requires an IPv4 gateway on the interface
- Caps broad subnets to `/24`
- Probes common ports and reads lightweight fingerprints
- Uses a persisted preferred detection method when available

The scanner remains Tapo-first internally, while the user-facing text stays brand-neutral.

## Streaming

- RTSP playback uses LibVLCSharp.WPF
- RTSP URLs are built from the configured username, password, host IP, and stream path
- Auto-stream can start playback automatically after detections are found
- Streams are stopped and disposed cleanly on close

## Diagnostics

- In Debug local runs, structured JSONL logs are written beside the launched executable
- Logging is disabled for Release and installed distributions
- Discovery, settings, snapshot, recording, and stream events are logged

## Tech Stack

- C# / .NET 10
- WPF (XAML)
- Target framework: `net10.0-windows10.0.19041.0`
- LibVLCSharp.WPF for video playback

## Build And Run

For routine development, use the fast Debug build:

```powershell
& "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\18\Community\MSBuild\Current\Bin\amd64\MSBuild.exe" .\LocalCam.csproj /t:Build /p:Configuration=Debug /p:RunAnalyzers=false /m
```

Launch the app from the Debug output:

```powershell
.\bin\Debug\net10.0-windows10.0.19041.0\LocalCam.exe
```
